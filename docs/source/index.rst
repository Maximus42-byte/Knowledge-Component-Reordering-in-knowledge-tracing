Welcome to PyKT's documentation!
========================================
PyKT is a python library build upon PyTorch to train deep learning based knowledge tracing models. The library consists of a standardized set of integrated data preprocessing procedures on multi popular datasets across different domains, 5 detailed prediction scenarios, frequently compared DLKT approaches for transparent and extensive experiments.
